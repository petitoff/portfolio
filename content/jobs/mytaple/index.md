- I developed and maintained web and mobile applications using Reactjs, React Native, TypeScript, and Redux in an Agile environment.

- My key responsibilities included designing and maintaining components integrated with Firebase APIs, and applying my knowledge of component lifecycle, state management, and navigation for enhanced user experiences.

- The result of our efforts was "mytaple", an application that consolidates local events, offers, and media into one platform, delivering them to users based on their location.

- **Skills**: TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, Navigation, React Native, Navigate, and Figma.
