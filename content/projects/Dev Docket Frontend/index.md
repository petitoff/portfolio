I created an application (and continue to develop it) for managing tasks within a team. The application has a feature for creating projects and tasks within the project. Tasks have implemented Markdown support in the task description. Currently, a Kanban board has been implemented to display tasks in three status columns for the task. <br /> <br />

The frontend was created in Vite (React) and communicates with the API using the Axios library. Everything was done in typescript.
